# Current Progress

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the FPGA project.

## Completed Features
- **Top-Level Architecture**: Mode switching logic implemented with handshake for transitions.
- **Display System**: OLED (96x64) and VGA (640x480) outputs fully functional.
- **Welcome Mode**: Complete welcome screen with OLED graphics and VGA interactive menu.
- **Button Debouncing**: 5-button debouncer prevents false triggers.
- **OFF Mode**: Blank screen mode for power-saving or reset.
- **Hardware Interface**: All Basys3 pins properly constrained (switches, buttons, OLED JB, VGA, PS2).

## Partially Implemented
- **Mode Transitions**: Logic exists for all 4 modes, but only OFF and WELCOME are fully instantiated.
- **OLED Drawing**: 14-segment character and diagonal line drawing modules available.
- **VGA Drawing**: 14-segment character and diagonal line drawing modules available.

## Not Implemented
- **Calculator Mode**: Module exists in features/ directory but not integrated into main.v.
- **Grapher Mode**: Module exists in features/ directory but not integrated into main.v.
- **PS2 Interface**: Tri-stated, no keyboard input implemented.
- **Timer Usage**: flexible_timer.v exists but not used.

## Known Issues
- Calculator and Grapher modules are not instantiated in Top_Student, so selecting them from welcome does nothing.
- Synthesis may fail due to resource constraints if additional modules are added without optimization.
- No error handling for invalid mode transitions.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate calculator_module and grapher_module into main.v.
2. Implement keypad input for calculator operations.
3. Add graphing logic for grapher mode.
4. Test full system on Basys3 board.
5. Optimize for LUT/FF usage if needed.

## Testing Status
- Welcome mode: Tested on hardware (OLED and VGA display).
- Mode switching: Simulated, transitions work.
- Display handler: Verified pixel multiplexing.
- Constraints: Valid for Basys3 board.

## File Status
- All core modules compile without syntax errors.
- Vivado project synthesizes for OFF and WELCOME modes.
- Bitstream generation successful for implemented features.
